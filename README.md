##Le Wagon London Batch #361 - AirBnb Clone Project Week

###LairBnb - Find Your Next Lair!

A light-hearted AirBnb clone created in one week as a group project during Le Wagon's 9-week Full Stack bootcamp. LairBnb is the sharing economy for superheroes and villains on the move. If you're in a new city and looking for a lair to rent or if you have a lair to rent out during your downtime then Lairbnb is the place for it.

Built with Ruby on Rails, using Cloudinary for content management and deployed on Heroku by a team of four.
